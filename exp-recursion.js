// What is recursion?
// Recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.
// Recursion is when a function that call itself.

// Why recursion?
// It is a great technique to simplify a solution

// ***
// Every recursive solution needs to have a base case - a condition to terminate the recursion else you'll have an infinite loop.
// Recursion might simplify solving teh problem but may not be a faster solution.
// Recusion is a topic that is not the most straightforward to understand.
